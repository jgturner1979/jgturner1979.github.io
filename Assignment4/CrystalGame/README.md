Assignment #4 - Crystal Game

My crystal game is based of the Infinity Stone from the Marvel Universe.

A random goal number is chosen and set.

Random value for 4 stones is set using the Math.random function.

The goal is for the player to click a stone and try to add up to the goal number that was chosen.

If the player goes over, then they lose the game, a loss is added to the count and can click the "Play again" button to reset the game to rest the goal number and stone values.

If the player matches the goal number, then they win, the count is added to the win tally and they can click "Play again" to to reset the goal number and stone values.
